## Project: Network & Application Monitoring

### Tags: #AGILE #SPRINTS #TEAMWORK #COMPANYPROJECTS #DEADLINES

### Company: Decospan

### Title: Network & Application Monitoring

### Brief:

Decospan aims to establish a new system for network and application monitoring. This system will focus on monitoring the most critical servers or applications. The student will conduct a comparison between Prometheus and Telegraf to decide which tool best suits our environment. Following the comparison presentation to the IT Infra team, the student will proceed to set up a proof of concept of the chosen solution. A dedicated screen will display the monitoring system dashboards at the IT Infra desk via Grafana. Additionally, alerts will be notified through Teams or another appropriate channel.

### Additional Information:

If the project progresses smoothly, exploring the possibility of SNMP monitoring via the chosen solution is also an option.

### Technologies:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

## Project: Remote Monitoring and Management Solution

### Tags: #AGILE #SPRINTS #TEAMWORK #COMPANYPROJECTS #DEADLINES

### Company: Decospan

### Title: Remote Monitoring and Management Solution

### Brief:

Currently utilizing N-able as an RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) tool, Decospan seeks an alternative solution as N-able does not meet expectations. The project's goal is to set up a proof of concept (POC) with a different RMM tool. The primary requirement for the tool is its capability to manage all devices via a cloud portal. Before implementing the POC, the student will conduct research on potential alternatives and their pros and cons. The student will then propose the findings to the IT Infra team, followed by the practical execution based on the chosen RMM tool.

### Additional Information:

If the POC progresses smoothly, there is an opportunity to develop an implementation plan to deploy the tool.

### Technologies:

Possible RMM tools:

- [Atera](https://www.atera.com/)
- [NinjaOne](https://www.ninjaone.com/)
- [Kaseya VSA](https://www.kaseya.com/products/vsa/)
- [Datto RMM](https://www.datto.com/products/rmm/)
